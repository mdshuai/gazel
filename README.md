gazel - a BUILD file generator for go and bazel
========

Requirements:
* Your project must be somewhat compatible with go tool because
  gazel uses go tool to parse your import tree.
* You must have a GOPATH and GOROOT setup and your project must
  be in the correct location in your GOPATH.
* Your ./vendor directory may not contain BUILD files.

Usage:

1. Get gazel by running go get github.com/mikedanese/gazel/gazel.

2. Create a .gazelcfg.json in the root of the repository. For the
   gazel repository, the .gazelcfg.json would look like:

   {
     "GoPrefix": "github.com/mikedanese/gazel",
     "SrcDirs": [
       "./gazel"
     ],
     "SkippedPaths": [
       ".*foobar(baz)?.*$"
     ]
   }

3. Run gazel:

  $ gazel -root=$GOPATH/src/github.com/mikedanese/gazel

Defaults:

* SrcDirs in .gazelcfg.json defaults to ["./"]
* -root option defaults to the current working directory

Automanagement:

gazel reconciles rules that have the "automanaged" tag. If
you no longer want gazel to manage a rule, you can remove the
automanaged tag and gazel will no longer manage that rule.

gazel only manages srcs, deps, and library attributes of a
rule after initial creation so you can add and managed other
attributes like data and copts and gazel will respect your
changes.

gazel automatically formats all BUILD files in your repository
except for those matching SkippedPaths.

Adding "sources" rules:

If you set "AddSourcesRules": true in your .gazelcfg.json,
gazel will create "package-srcs" and "all-srcs" rules in every
package.

The "package-srcs" rule is a glob matching all files in the
package recursively, but not any files owned by packages in
subdirectories.

The "all-srcs" rule includes both the "package-srcs" rule and
the "all-srcs" rules of all subpackages; i.e. //:all-srcs will
include all files in your repository.

The "package-srcs" rule defaults to private visibility,
since it is safer to depend on the "all-srcs" rule: if a
subpackage is added, the "package-srcs" rule will no longer
include those files.

You can remove the "automanaged" tag from the "package-srcs"
rule if you need to modify the glob (such as adding excludes).
It's recommended that you leave the "all-srcs" rule
automanaged.

Getting latest stable version:

The latest tagged release of gazel is v11. To get the latest
stable version of gazel run:

$ go get -u gopkg.in/mikedanese/gazel.v11/gazel

Validating BUILD files in CI:

If you run gazel with --validate, it will not update any BUILD files, but it
will exit nonzero if any BUILD files are out-of-date. You can add --print-diff
to print out the changes needed.
